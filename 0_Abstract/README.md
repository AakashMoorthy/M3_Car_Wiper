# PROJECT TITTLE - WIPER CONTROL SYSTEM 

# ABSTRACT :
* A wiper speed control system for an automobile wiper regulates the operating speed of a wiper in accordance with the amount of rain falling on the windshield. This is a very much essential component in each automobile as it avoids the risk of accidents during rainy conditions.

* Water, snow, dust, and road spray are all removed from a vehicle's windscreen by the windshield wipers. The early windshield wipers were manually operated by moving a lever located inside the vehicle's interior. Later wiper designs were powered by the manifold vacuum generated by the engine. In today's world, virtually all wipers are powered by an electric motor connected to a linkage system, and they are controlled by a knob located next to the steering wheel. The driver has the ability to control the speed of the wiper blades.

* Modern windshield wipers can also be operated on an as-needed basis. The intermittent wiper option, as opposed to the continuous wiper option, cycles the wipers on and off every few seconds rather than operating continuously. It was in the 1970s that intermittent control made its debut in autos. A steady power source was used to control the original intermittent wipers, which were routed through a series of switches to achieve their functionality. Most automobile wipers are now controlled by a microprocessor, which is becoming increasingly common.

* Many wiper systems in cars today are controlled by a rain sensor, which measures the speed at which raindrops hit the windshield and activates the wipers. The inputs from the sensor are evaluated by a microprocessor, which then calculates the speed at which the wipers should travel.
